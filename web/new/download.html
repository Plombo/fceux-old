		<p>FCEUX is written for two platforms: SDL and Win32. The two ports have some significant differences. 
		The Win32 port has an extensive set of native gui amenities and tools. 
		The SDL port supports many of the features of the Win32 build (Lua scripting, movie recording), 
		however some of the Win32 features are exclusive to the platform. The Win32 port has a built-in GUI, 
		whereas the SDL port has a GTK launcher GUI. The SDL port should run any UNIX-like OS (Linux/Solaris/BSD).
		</p>
		
		<p>Network play is not presently functional. Fixing it is a high priority.</p>
		
		<h4>Win32</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>As of 2.1.2, Lua is integrated into the binary, the luapack is no longer necessary.</li>
			<li>Be sure to check out the .chm file (Under Help > Help... in the emulator main menu). We work pretty hard on keeping that up to date. 
				<ul><li>We also keep a (fairly) up to date <a href="fceux-2.0.2.htm">online version</a></li></ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>SDL</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://scons.org/">Scons is required to build from source.</a></li>
			<li>Requires SDL, libz, and zenity</li>
			<li>Liblua5.1 and OpenGL are optional, but recommended.</li>
			<li><a href="http://dietschnitzel.com/gfceu">GFCEUX</a>, a GTK2 GUI for fceux, is included in the source release. All non-windows users of the SDL port are reccommended to install and use this, unless you particularly prefer the command-line.</li>
			<li>For instructions on installing on an Ubuntu or Debian system, check the how to at <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=971455">Ubuntuforums.</a></li>
