   <p>
     FCEUX is a cross platform, NTSC and PAL Famicom/NES emulator that is an evolution of the original FCE Ultra emulator.  
     Over time FCE Ultra had separated into many separate branches.
   </p>
   <p>
     The concept behind FCEUX  is to merge elements from FCE Ultra, FCEU rerecording, FCEUXD, FCEUXDSP, and FCEU-umm into a single branch of FCEU.
     As the  X implies , it is a all encompassing FCEU emulator that gives the best of all worlds for the general player,
     the ROM-hacking community, and the Tool-Assisted Speedrun Community.
