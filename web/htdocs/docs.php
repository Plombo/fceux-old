 <li>Documentation for the SDL build is <a href="fceux-sdl-docs.php">available here</a>
 <li>Windows users should look at the CHM which is packaged with the binary, or go <a href=http://fceultra.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fceultra/fceu/src/drivers/win/help/fceux.chm>directly to it</a>; but you cannot open it directly out of IE, as Microsoft feels that this would be a security hazard. You'd better save it first and then unblock it from the file properties.
 <br>Some of the SDL documentation might be informative to Windows users--so if the CHM doesn't answer your question, give it a shot.
 <li>TAS folks might like to look at the <a href="http://fceultra.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/fceultra/fceu/documentation/fm2.txt">FM2 spec</a>
 <li>You might be interested in the <a href="fceu-docs.php">old FCE ultra docs</a>, but they are dangerously out of date.
